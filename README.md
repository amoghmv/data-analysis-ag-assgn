## Antarctica Global Assignment Questions - Data Analyst

This repository contains my solutions to the below questions. It includes SQL queries and Python-based analytics using packages like pandas, matplotlib, numpy

1. **Lead Generation Efficiency** 
Ratio of leads generated to time spent — who is most efficient?

2. **Daily Performance Variability**  
Standard deviation of daily leads — who is most inconsistent?

3. **Time Management Analysis**
Correlation between time per lead and total leads generated

4. **Impact of Daily Team Reviews**  
Difference in performance on days when team reviews were attended vs missed

5. **Incomplete Leads Trend**  
Regression trend over time — are incomplete leads reducing over time?

6. **Performance Consistency**  
Coefficient of variation — who is the most consistent performer?

7. **High-Performance Days**  
Top 10% lead-gen days — how much time was spent in those top days?

8. **Optimal Time Threshold**  
Is there a “sweet spot” for time spent that boosts leads?

9. **Weekday vs Weekend Performance**  
Comparing average leads between weekdays and weekends
(also added mid-week for deeper analysis)

11. **Predictive Analysis**  
Simple linear regression to predict leads based on time spent

If running the code is not an option, 
the /captures folder an be opened to look for the output
